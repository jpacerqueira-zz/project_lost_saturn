These provided a 30% increase in accuracy over traditional C++ imaging engines. These were written in Python using TensorFlow and deployed as a container each.  \u2022 Explored cheaper, reliable and productive Azure services and implemented them. I broke down a bloated Azure Service Fabric solution to small, manageable, easily updatable, microservice-based, dockerised solutions. This allowed us to release updates frequently and seamlessly. \u2022 Created data pipelines using python and deployed the containerised version to Azure. This was a cheaper and more customisable option than using Azure Data Factory. This saved over \u00a31500 per month. \u2022 Wrote serverless code on Azure functions using C#. For small independent tasks, this proved effective. \u2022 Scripted ARM templates for managing resources on Azure. This was much faster to manage infrastructure.  \u2022 Set up Kubernetes on Azure and deploying containers to K8s pods. Deployments are seamless as Kubernetes manage sending traffic to the most updated pods. \u2022 Created full solution architecture for a scalable solution with cost kept low. Saved over \u00a310k every month.  \u2022 Interviewed, onboarded and mentored new software engineers. \u2022 Evaluated cloud providers including AWS and GCP for serving machine learning models.  \u2022 Established high standards on source control such as code reviews on pull requests on Git. This prevents countless bugs being pushed to production. \u2022 Streamlining our overall cloud usage to using Azure and transferred files and hosted apps from AWS S3 and EC2 to Azure Blob Storage and Azure App Service. Once complete, it cut the cost of \u00a37k per month. \u2022 Wrote CPU-throttling, multi-threaded, automated regression tests to test C++ imaging engines to the core. These tests proved very effective to benchmark the performance of complex imaging engines. \u2022 Evaluated Azure Data Factory and created multiple data pipelines. It was a very rapid way to create data pipelines. \u2022 Wrote complex SQL queries, views and stored procedures in association with data pipelines and data staging process. \u2022 Set up Splunk, Mixpanel and Azure Application Insights for user journeys, apps telematics and error reporting.

I created 1000 images per word. There were 140,000 words. The algorithm allows me to easily scale and create as much images as necessary. I wrote a simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to recognise the images. The CNN was thus, trained on computer generated data. However, I verified that it can even recognise hand-written words. This shows that, one, deep learning is powerful enough to be trained on computer generated data and recognise real world objects and, two, even simple CNN architecture proved fruitful in this endeavour.  Training a robotic arm using Reinforcement Learning                                  2018 \u2022 I am working on a project where I apply Augmented Random Search (ARS) algorithm (a reinforcement learning algorithm) to a robotic arm. This algorithm along with an object recognition algorithm using OpenCV is used to pick up objects and place them elsewhere. There is a lot of room for improvement in this system        \f"}]}
